# Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that can function as a parking interface at the UPY, with the aim of being able to select and reserve a spot for a certain amount of time, in order to have better parking control. 
The application is designed so that a user registration of 4 types can be made:

- Institutional email
- Name and surname
- Vehicle registration
- Vehicle description
- Vehicle type
- Photo

# Django project develop
The project is mainly developed with Django to start the server and be able to have the Python requirements to start easily. After that, the Front-End templates are implemented where most of the development takes place.

# Front-End
Primarily, HTML will be used to design the user interface to have a web authentication system.

- HTML Login
This HTML code is used for the login page, where existing users can access their accounts by providing valid credentials. The form collects the username and password, which are essential to authenticate and authorise the user, ensuring that each user session is secure and private.

-Authentication HTML 
The second code corresponds to an authentication page, probably used to verify the user's identity before allowing access to sensitive areas or critical functions within the application. This form could be integrated into two-factor authentication flows or to confirm the user's identity before performing significant operations, thus improving the overall security of the system.

- Registration HTML
The third code snippet is for a registration page, allowing new users to create an account in the system. This form collects detailed information, including first name, last name, email address, and prompts the user to create a password. It also includes password confirmation to avoid typos, ensuring that the data entered is correct and validated to maintain the integrity of the user's information. Together, these HTML snippets are critical components of the project's authentication and authorisation functionality, ensuring that only authenticated and authorised users can access their accounts and perform actions within the application. These pages are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while maintaining high standards of security and privacy.

The CSS codes provided are designed to style authentication and registration forms in a web application, focusing on usability and visual aesthetics. These styles apply a consistent colour palette, pleasing typography and centred alignment to enhance the user experience and encourage intuitive interaction. CSS ensures that forms are not only functional but also visually appealing, facilitating navigation and providing a user-friendly interface. These styles contribute to the visual cohesion of the project, maintaining consistency across different pages and forms.
