Introduction.

The Booking Spot project is a parking lot system that, through an application, will provide better management of parking spaces for the Polytechnic University of Yucatan. This project will be beneficial for the students as well as for the teachers and administrators of the school. and it could be extrapolated to different institutions without major complications.

The main objective of Booking Spot is to provide students of the UPY community with a safe means of protecting their vehicles in the institution's parking lot as well as ensuring that upon arrival at the institution there is a safe parking space validated by the institution, avoiding car conglomerations and bottlenecks at the exits of this space.

It is anticipated that this system could be used by students and teachers, with the audit of the institution's administrators to control the cars entering and leaving the parking lot.
